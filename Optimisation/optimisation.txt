How a mechine learn?

LR = just used linear equation 
here those that are beyond LR

3 step machine learning process:
 
1. make a prediction
2. Calculating the error ( we need to measure how could the prediction)
3. adjust our initial prediction ( learn from mistake)
repea above steps again we have to go back to step1. using out new prediction we do the same things.(repeat until the machine get learning)
    this is called machine learning model ( also called algorithm)
    
Introduction to Cost Functions

how do we calculate the error exactly
