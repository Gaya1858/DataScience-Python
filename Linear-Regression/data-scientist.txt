data scientist
Formulate questions based the files your working.In this case Movie
    how much revenue will that our movie make?
    overall movie budget?
    can we use movie budget to predict movie revenue?
    Revenue dependant variable, budget independent variable


1. collect/gather data
    Data on feature - movie budgets in USD
    Data on target - movie revenue in USD
2. clean data
    cleaning for
        Missing data
        Incomplete data
        inaccurate data
        formatting
3. explore/ visualize data
    used pandas to read the CSV cleaned file and made X and Y columns
    using matplotlib.pyplot, created scatter plot.
    tried some pyplot arguments like x, y labels , plot title, size and transparancy(alpha=0.3)
4. Train algorithm(using computer identify pattern
    linear regression equation y= mx+c
    in ML hQ(x)(Q -theta) ---- y 
          Q0 ---- intercept value (c)
          Q1(x) ==== Q1 is slope(m)
          when you fit line in the plot it is called fitted line
          and points distance from the fitted line called residual line when you make a line in between
          more- please check the handwrittten notes
          library sklearn(scikit Learn)to do the linear regression 
          regression.coef_ --- for slope value
          regression.intercept_ --- for intercept value
          regression.predict to plot fitted line on the plot
5. Evaluate the data
